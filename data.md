## Knowledge Base and Database Comparison

In the realm of Expert Systems and Machine Learning, it is crucial to distinguish between knowledge bases and databases, recognizing their unique roles and characteristics.

**Knowledge Base:**

A knowledge base acts as a repository for domain-specific knowledge, rules, and expertise employed in expert systems and decision-making processes. It encompasses well-structured domain-specific information intended for problem-solving. In expert systems, the knowledge base consists of rules and facts that govern the decision-making process.

**Database:**

In contrast, a database functions as a structured repository for data storage, retrieval, and management. Databases are designed for efficient data storage and retrieval and play a fundamental role in numerous data-driven applications. They typically store raw data and facilitate structured querying and retrieval, often utilizing the Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation.

In summary, a knowledge base focuses on domain-specific reasoning and decision-making, utilizing explicit rules and knowledge. Conversely, a database primarily deals with the structured storage and retrieval of data, without inherent reasoning capabilities.
